## Create a GitHub repository

It has to be public.

## Set up Travis

I didn't have a [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) account. Creating one is easy
if you already have a Github account: just visit the Travis site and click
"Sign in with GitHub". You'll have to approve some permissions Travis needs,
but they are reasonable.

Go to [your profile page](https://travis-ci.org/profile/) and select the
organization (or yourself) where you created the repository. Then find the
repository listed and click it to turn on Travis builds for it.
